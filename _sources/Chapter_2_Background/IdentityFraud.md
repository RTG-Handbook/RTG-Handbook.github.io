# Fraud scenarios in identity systems

We start by taking a survey of the types of fraud identity systems could be at risk to {cite}`amosipdata`.

1. **Identity theft/ Fake accounts** 
    * Registration in the name of an individual who is dead.
    * Fake supporting documents such as proof of identity, address proof, age proof etc.
    * Pre-registrations done from outside the country.
    * Pre-registrations done from a single host multiple times.
2. **Registration operator related** 
    * Registering a child with an invalid introducer (perhaps using the operatorâ€™s identity).
    * A registration operator is taking way more time than the standard time.
    * A registration operator has been disabled, but there could be attempted registrations.
3. **Registration centre related**
    * Registration that happens outside the windows of working hours.
    * Frequent registrations happening from one or more centres using manual adjudication.
    * A registration centre has been decommissioned, but there could be attempted registrations.
